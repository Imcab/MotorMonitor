## **Installation Guide**

!!! warning "Supported Languajes"
    This file is only made in **Java**, C++ or other languajes are **NOT** supported

Motor Monitor is a file that you can add to your robot package. Click on the download button or [here](SourceFile/MotorMonitor.java "download"), move the downloaded file to your robot's **directory** and Thats it!

We recommend **creating a folder in your project** for more organization, in our case we create the folder `\Utils` to save the motor monitor and other utils we made through the season. You should get something like this:

`\java\frc\robot\Utils\MotorMonitor.java`

Now that you get the file and place it in the ideal location we can start to use it through the `MotorMonitor` *class*
